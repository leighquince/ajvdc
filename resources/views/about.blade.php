                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is listed by UN as one of the 50 poorest countries in the world, the most hunger country in Africa. The IMF reported average per capita income in the DRC in 2008 was just $194</p>

                <p>EasternCongo is composed of 90% of arable land, but according to the World Food Programme, only 2% of this land is being utilized.</p>

                <p>Investment in creating income generating opportunities for Congolese people is one of the most effective ways to lift cititizens out of the cycle of poverty, offering tremendous potential for increasing stability, and opening doors to improved health and education.</p>

                <p>The AJVDC entrepreneurship program aims to focus on youth education and agriculture that can help many unemployed youth capitalize on their areaâ€™s rich potential and help develop a wider economic base, providing jobs for Congolese youth.</p>

                <p>Investment in economic development means generating income and opportunities for the youth of the DRC, those people who have been either involved in, or been victims of hostilities and war in Eastern DRC. This is the fastest and most sustainable way to reintegrate thousands of young boys and girls that have been enrolled in armed groups due to their lack of education, unemployment and political manipulation.</p>

                <p>The AJVDC Entrepreneurship program is focusing on investment in agricultural activities, something that is crucial for development in the Eastern DRC. In a country where food is a challenge for most citizens, agriculture must play the leading role in development of population.</p>
