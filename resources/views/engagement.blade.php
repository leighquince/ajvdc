                <h2>Situation Analysis </h2>
                <h4>Main Issues of the region </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Presence of many negative  Armed groups; </li>
                    <li>Youth unemployment ( high rate of youth unemployment);</li>
                    <li>Displacing of people due to wars, land conflicts, community conflicts, mining conflicts,</li>
                    <li>High number of women victims of rape ( sexual violence);</li>
                    <li>Poverty and hunger (86% of people living with less than 1$ per day)</li>
                    <li>Social and economic reintegration of high number youth and children ex-combatants (more than 4000 ex-combatants and 10.000  youth are willing to abandon their armed groups)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The areas of intervention of this project are located in Eastern of Congo, the region of Democratic Republic of Congo the most affected by 2 decades of wars, and many different conflicts (community conflicts, land conflicts, mining conflicts, sexual violence, armed groups and high rate of poverty and human rights violations);
                <p>The territories of Masisi, Rutshuru, Nyiragongo and Goma are located in North Kivu, Kalehe is located in South Kivu in Eastern of Congo bordered to Rwanda and Uganda on the East,  Kivu region is very rich of different mineral ( oil, coltan, gold, diamond …) and other natural resources, forest, rivers and a huge arable land that can be used for agriculture and tourist business. </p>
                <p>TThe Eastern of Congo is the region the most affected by war and the most unstable province of Democratic Republic of Congo since 1993 up to recently 2014 with the entrance of Rwandan Huntu refugee, and many rebellions movement ,  AFDL, RCD, CNDP, M23 and many other negatives Armed groups, MAI MAI local negative armed groups that are spread in every village in this region, currently the list  goes to more than 50 local negative Armed groups,  plus foreign rebellions movements,  FDLR Rwandan Huntu rebellion, ADF-NALU, and LRA Ugandan rebellions.
                The long political instability and many other crises (community conflicts, land and mineral conflicts, poverty,…) in  Democratic Republic of Congo have affected negatively the population, strongly the disadvantaged groups ( children, women and youth). Women and girls have been raped, youth and children are enrolled by force in armed groups.</p>
                <p>TThe Democratic Republic of Congo is listed by UN as one of the 50 poorest countries in the world, the most hunger country in Africa. The IMF reported average per capita income in the DRC in 2008 was just $194. Approximately seventy percent of the people the Eastern of Congo region are living under poverty scale, less 1$ per day.
                In the research of the reestablishing peace and stability in DRC, there is an UN mission (MONUSCO) Mission of United Nations for stability, of about 20 000 soldiers is in the Country since 2002 to support the DRC government to bring peace and fight against rebellions and end armed groups, foreign and local armed groups,</p>
                <p>TThis UN mission has now last in DRC for more 12 years in DRC but the situation have never got better. The period of 2012 - 2013 a new rebellion called M23 has occupied a big party of Goma , Nyiragongo, Masisi and Rutshuru,  when they have killed, raped and enrolled many youth in their Armed group. Currently 2014 the ADF- NALU terrorist movement has killed many innocent civilian people in Beni territory northern part of North Kivu province.  </p>
                <p>TMany efforts are now made by international communities, UN and the Democratic Republic of Congo government, FARDC government army to put end to these armed groups and to establish peace.</p>
                <p>TThrough this militaries operations and many disarment and demobilization initiatives made by different national and International efforts and by MONUSCO, many youth are withdrawing from the Armed groups and willing to reintegrate the civilian life.
                Eastern of Congo has suffered heavy losses due to this decade long war and conflicts (1993 -2014) and other atrocities (poverty, youth unemployment, hunger, sexual violence, lake of education …). The conflicts displaced 8 million people; killed almost 6 million citizens (UNOCHA 2013 reports); and, eroded trust within and between communities. </p>
                <p>TYouth were at the core of the conflict, either through recruitment into armed groups or as victims of social destabilization, causing a high number of children and youth to become combatants.</p>

                <h2>Project activities and strategies </h2>
                <h4>1. Forming of Youth Peace Clubs </h4>
                <p>Viewing youth as a potential force for positive change, the project VIJANA WA AMANI will identify volunteer youth and regroup them in small groups that will form Youth Peace Clubs, in different entities and areas (villages), at Schools, Universities, Churches, Villages. Different ethnics groups and castes will be represented in each Youth Peace Club to improve the diversity of - and interaction between – participating. A total of 100 YPC will be formed in 5 territories ( Goma, Rutshuru, Masisi, Kelehe, Nyiragongo)</p>

                <h4>2. Developing youth capacities </h4>
                <p>The project will provide capacity building opportunities for 5000 youth in the thematic areas of peace-building, leadership, management, social mobilization and project management. 200 of these youth will participate in the Master Training of Trainers (TOT) program; these Master Trainers later will conduct 15 peace-building trainings for 100 Youth Peace Clubs members. Additionally, youth will learn mediation skills that allow them to facilitate non-violent conflict resolution</p>

                <h4>3. Building stronger networks between youth from different communities and areas.</h4>
                <p>Two general youth assemblies, 18 sports competitions and 12 cultural programs involving all youths will be organized through VIJANA WA AMANI project. These programs positively will contribute towards building good relationships, developing stronger networks, and narrowing differences among participating youth from different communities, ethnic groups and castes.</p>

                 <h4>4. Bridging the Gap between Adults, Decision-maker, government and Youth:</h4>
                <p>The project will facilitate over 36 coordination meetings, including 12 meetings with traditional decision-making bodies (local authorities, local government, local parliament, and community elders). Additionally, 50 parent-youth meetings will be held. The ensuing discussions will be instrumental in contributing to an improved level of understanding between - and to collective action involving - adults and youth, resulting in a higher representation of youth in community decision-making structures.</p>

                 <h4>5. Mobilizing Youth in Community Services:</h4>
                <p>Youth will contribute to the completion of Social Service Projects (SSPs): building community halls, water and sanitation, culverts and latrines; repairing agricultural roads and furniture; and, supporting livestock production and fish farming. In addition to providing basic services to communities, the SSPs will also help to build stronger relationships within the villages and other stakeholders, including NGOs and local government. Youth will contribute almost 8 hours per week the minimum contribution to the SSPs,</p>

                 <h4>6. Mobilizing Youth to Promote Peace and Reconciliation:</h4>
                <p>5000 youth will be mobilized to promote community peace and reconciliation through the (Peace talks) meetings, discussions, trainings, and SSPs; the production and airing of  radio broadcasting peace programs; participation in street dramas and cross/exposure visits; and, organizing and participating in  peace promotion competitions at schools and Universities.</p>

                <h2>Project Impact</h2>
                <p>After the implementation of VIJANA WA AMANI project, we expect significant qualitative impacts in youth and community, including enhanced self confidence and self esteem, improved leadership skills, improved respect for the positive role of youth within communities, reduced caste and ethnic barriers to interaction and collaboration between youth and enhanced dispute resolution capacities.  Over the life of the project, a significant decrease in quantitative indicators will be observed. In addition to other efforts made by International humanitarian organizations and Peacebuilding programs, VIJANA WA AMANI also make a significant contribution by getting youth (ex-combatants) reintegrated in their communities.</p>

                <p>VIJANA WA AMANI project will benefit socially and economically for the communities resilience, specifically for disadvantaged group; returnee refugees, displaced, women victims of rape and education of children ex-combatants, and to build a peaceful spaces for youth, children and women.</p>
